Shell Flags (shFlags) is a library written to greatly simplify the handling of command-line flags in Bourne based Unix shell scripts (`bash`, `dash`, `ksh`, `sh`, `zsh`) on many Unix OSes (Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, etc.).

Most shell scripts use `getopt` for flags processing, but the different versions of `getopt` on various OSes make writing portable shell scripts difficult. shFlags instead provides an API that doesn't change across shell and OS versions so the script writer can be confident that the script will work.

shFlags is a port of the [google-gflags](http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/) C++/Python library.
